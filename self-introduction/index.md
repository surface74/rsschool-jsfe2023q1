  My name is Siarhei Muliarenka.
  At the current time I'm a debuty of the head of IT department of a chemical plant.
  I manage a team of developers. Our team developes and maintainces a set of programs for ERP. So the base framework is 1C and there're some projects with C#, ASP.NET and JAVA.
  I graduated from Polotsk State University as an engineer-designer of electronic equipment and I'am currently attending the RSSchool frontend course.
  My first computer was Sinclear ZX Spectrum, which I made by miself, and its Basic and my first Assembler programm. Then it were БК-0001 and ДВК-2 with Focal and so on.
  I have started my cariera as a programmer for SCADA-systems. I developed the software to control the chemical proсesses. Then I have some courses of programming PLC-controllers: Allan Bredlly and Siemens. At the same time I got some skills in C# - ASP.Net - SQL stack to develop software for integration SCADA-systems with the ERP-system.

  Some times ago I've become passionate the Web Development. It provides you enless possibilities for develope anything you can imagine. Well, I'm not sure in my artistic ability, but I like ' to make the car move'.

  My last project is a programm for gathering data from devices which send emails. The goal is to introduce this data to Enterprise level. The task includes the checking senders' addresses, email subjects, type of attachments and so on. Then I've needed to extract data from messages and save them to SQL Server. To solve it I've used NodeJS by combining 3 modules together. It works perfect but there's one problem - I can't compile it to executable file yet.

  I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a professional Frontend or NodeJS Developer.
